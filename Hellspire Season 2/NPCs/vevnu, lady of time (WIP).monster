The portal lasts for 24 hours or until the dragon's concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is transported to the destination, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
