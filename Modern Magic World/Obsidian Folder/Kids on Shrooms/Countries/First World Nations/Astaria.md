Astaria is the biggest country in the world of Avira. Publicly, it is the arguably the most technologically developed nation and has likely the most formidable military force.

Astaria has a representative democratic - oligarchic political structure, and a capitalistic economy.

In the world of Avira, Astaria reflects the United States for the purpose of achieving a setting in this world similar to an American high school. Although Astaria shares a similar destination in culture to it's real life counterpart, its history is vastly different, and its culture is still very different in many important ways.

To the public population of Astaria, the knowledge of spirits and magic of the world is unknown. The people who have knowledge of magic in this country are less than one percent of the population, with almost all of the people being part of the top 1%.

## Organization Structure:
The Astarian government is mostly a representative democracy. There is an element to the government structure that is oligarchic, in the respect where the governing party as an overwhelming amount of control to continue keeping the ruling party in control.  
  
The government is broken down into two jointed departments: the Ruling Parliament, and the Council of Experts.

The Ruling Parliament holds the majority of the law and decision making power of the government. It consists of a house with 100 chairmen representatives from across the country, and one ruling Elder Chancellor. This Ruling Parliament functions with the chairmen individually having the power to develop or carry propositions of new laws. (Laws are developed when the chairmen draft the law themselves, and they are carried if the law had been proposed by a citizen and passed to the chairmen in some capacity.) Whenever a law is proposed to the Parliament, it is first passed to the Council of Experts for adjustment and review. If the law was developed by the chairman, the chairman can choose half of the experts assigned to review the law. If the law was instead carried by the chairman, they can choose all of the experts that review the law. Once the law is returned from the Council of Experts, it is passed to the chairman, where they can either decide to send it into the Council of Experts again, or to pass it into Parliament Queue. Whenever a law reaches the top of the Parliament Queue, the law is voted on by the Parliament.

The Council of Experts is a collection of teams, each team representing different concerning interests that the government wants laws to respect. Some concerning interests include the economy, the environment, public infrastructure, public safety and much more. Once a law is passed to the Council of Experts for review, it enters a queue. When the law reaches the top of the queue, the review process begins. The most powerful team in the council is called the Experts of Reception, who start the review process. This team does not dictate any changes to the law, but instead reviews the law and decides which teams of experts are called to act in the review process of the bill. Once the teams have been decided, one person from each team will be assigned to review the bill. If the chairman carried the bill, the chairman will decide one expert from each team to review the bill. If the chairman developed the bill, they will decide one expert from half of the teams, and the Experts of Reception will choose the rest. In this scenario, the chairman decides which half of the teams they have power over. Once the review team is decided, the team reviews and appends the law and returns the law to the Ruling Parliament.

The Elder Chancellor is the most powerful person in the Astarian Government. The Elder Chancellor holds the same power that the chairmen do, where they are able to develop or carry a law to Parliament. When the Elder Chancellor carries a law, the law is immediately sent to the Council of Experts and bypasses any laws in queue. The once the Experts of Reception decide which teams review the bill, the Elder Chancellor decides every member of the final review team from the chosen teams. Once the law returns to the Elder Chancellor, they can either decide to send it back to the Council of Experts, or keep it as is. If the Elder Chancellor decides to keep the law as is, it is immediately passed into being active, bypassing the rest of Parliament.

Excluding laws drafted by the Elder Chancellor, the vote to pass a law into action has specific rules. The Elder Chancellor holds 25% of the vote, and the rest of Parliament holds 75%. For a law to be passed, it must gain 50% of the vote or higher. This means either at least two thirds of Parliament must be voting for the law, or one thirds and the Elder Chancellor must be voting for the law.

Regarding lengths of terms, every position in Parliament, including the Elder Chancellor, holds position for three years. Every position in the Council of Experts holds positions for six years. Every three years, before the public election begins, a vote is held in Parliament regarding the Elder Chancellor and every chairman. If a chairman receives more than 50% vote to leave (with the Elder Chancellor holding 25% of the vote), their position is held up for a popular public vote. If the Elder Chancellor receives more 60% vote to leave from the rest of Parliament, their position is held up for a popular public vote. Whenever an Expert reaches the end of their six years, they are put up for the same vote as the chairmen. This occurs one year before the public election is held, allowing time for campaigning.

The government also has different departments besides the Ruling Parliament that handles issues separate from law making and the public agenda. Each of these departments are referred to as Houses.

The House of Centralized Intelligence (HCI) is a department that acts generally out of the public eye to handle the national security of the country. This house employs the best individuals of the country as officers and operators to engage in covert missions relating to the most severe national threats.

# **SECRETS**
## Secrets of the HCI
Officers of the HCI are actively on domestic or foreign missions attempting to solve cases relating to national security, and operators are the strategists that design the missions and get the officers anything they need. These cases are not only handled outside of the public eye, but are executed without a court of law or due process. The HCI has been employed by members of Parliament (with enough reputation and status) to handle things ranging from measures of personal affairs to large political moves. Employing the HCI usually goes completely hidden from the public, but can occasionally make its way back to Parliament if the move is too big, so chairmen need to be careful on this front.

## Magic in Civics
The Astarian Government in many ways is proxied by the Scholars of Avira. The Scholars of Avira have their influences in most of the governments in the world, and place chairmen indoctrinated into the Scholars organization, typically as well as The Church of Abus into elections and into the congress.  
The federal government is about 40/60 in regards to the knowledge of magic, with 40% knowledgeable to the factor magic plays in the world, and 60% blind to it like the majority of the population. However, of the 40%, most are indoctrinated with the Scholars, half of them know any spell craft ,and only a very small handful are classified as Wizards. The handful in Parliament that are Wizards are native to Aviani and are placed into the government from originally being in the Scholars of Avira, instead of being originally a politician that has been indoctrinated.

The Elder Chancellor has a specific clause in the Nullified Arcanum Chapters of the Concordant Encyclopedia. The clause dictates that the Elder Chancellor must be subject to learning enough magic to be titled Wizard and that they must have a Grand Wizard assigned to them as an Honorary Advisor from the Scholars of Avira. Although the title suggests that the advisor might work for the Elder Chancellor, the working relationship has the advisor as a supervisory administer to the Elder Chancellor.

### The HUMI
The federal government also houses a sister organization called the HUMI (House of Unknown and Magical Intelligence), which is usually dealt cases that are determined to be magical of some nature by the HCI. The HUMI has a central organization in the federal government that consists of a board of wizards and many mages and artificer agents. The HUMI also has at least one team in every major city, with a team consisting of a mage-artificer strike team and a wizard that leads the team.
