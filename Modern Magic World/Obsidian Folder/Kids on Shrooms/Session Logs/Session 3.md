We opened up to the end of sixth period. Right after the bell rang, [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] attempted at starting a conversation with [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]], and she responded saying "Don't fucking talk to me." Attempting to recover, [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]], [[Ian Long (Aaron)]], and [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] talked about the requirements they need for the [[Math Club]] they are attempting to start, and decided to try to go and talk to a teacher about being the sponsor of the Math Club, [[Joshua Campbell|Mr. Campbell]]. In talking to Mr. Campbell, he tells the three that he would be super on board for a Math Club as it would fit his schedule and he thinks it would be a good opportunity for some of his students to get better at math. [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] mentioned how [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] told him to "Don't fucking talk to me", and Mr. Campbell took that as a serious incident of bullying, and will report it to administration. The group splits from the math classroom, with [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] missing her bus, and [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] taking [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] and Marlowe home.

A few minutes ago, right after leaving the Aviran 2 classroom, [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] rushes out after lashing out to Caspian. [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] quickly follows, and asks if she is ok. The two discuss that they've been having some weird past couple of days. Shen questions Benito, as she clocks how they both have peculiarly similar responses, and Benito proposes that he is going to where the weird stuff happened and asks if Shen wants to come. She agrees and they both head to the student parking lot. Getting ready to leave the school, [[Rachel De Narris]] is in the student parking lot, and [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] successfully sneaks by her, but Benito is spotted. They enter the car and head towards Benito's house.

Deciding to go to [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]]'s house, the three ([[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] and [[Ian Long (Aaron)]]) are driven there by [[Jessica May|Caspian's Mom]]. On the way, Sicko Mode comes on and Marlowe sings along, causing Caspian, Ian, and Jessica to all catch on fire. They pull over, and Marlowe begins to realize that she caused the fire somehow with her voice. Caspain was the only one who took an injury from this. [[Vincenzo (Vince) Melville|Marlowe's Father]] comes to pick Marlowe up, and Ian asks Marlowe if she's ok and tells her that he recognized that she did that. Ian asks if she thinks its cool, and she responds by saying she's currently horrified. Her father takes her home, and after the mechanic tells Caspian's mom that the car is ok, she drives the two to Caspian's home.

In arriving at [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]]'s house, Benito headed inside and found that his [[Fulan (Familiar)|window had been broken into]], and the seed that he stored in his secret compartment of his bedside dresser was stolen. He rushes out and begins to tell [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] about his weird situation the day before. Shen then successfully illusions herself into Benito, showcasing her weird magic events that have been happening to her. The two begin following the trail of flora leading away from Benito's house, and eventually see a [[Apricot (Alvin)|chipmunk]] that begins sprinting away from the two. Benito calls after the chipmunk, and sees that he has the seed. The chipmunk begins to yell back to Benito, with only Benito understanding him. Once Shen catches the chipmunk and Benito takes the seed back, the chipmunk begins gradually speaking clear Aviran to both Benito and Shen, with the chipmunk gaining sentience and bonding with Benito as his familiar. The crazy commotion of a talking chipmunk caused the three to get decently loud, and once they realized they quickly headed back to Benito's car and started their way to the park.

Getting home with [[Vincenzo (Vince) Melville|her father]], [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] had a talk with him in which he asked what happened, and warned her about mean kids at school, thinking that they might have pulled a mean prank on her and not wanting her to get hurt by these kids. He didn't consider any possibility of magic, and trusts his daughter to not have done something like play with fire, and ends up accusing her friends of the fire. After the conversation, Marlowe heads over to the [[Ulism]] shrine at their home, and begins to investigate thinking of her divination she had last night. She found out about [[The Great Whale]], [[The Strong Goat]], and [[The Mountain Serpent]]. She then slowly realized that her singing was likely responsible for some other weird things that had been happening around her recently, like the people on the bus shitting themselves in the morning, her divination last night during their prayer song, and even Shen yesterday falling asleep on the bus. But she then began to realize something stranger. She pushed passed a barrier in her mind and unlocked the memory of the night she first entered [[Astaria]]. When boarding the life rafts with her [[Guilia Melville|mother]] and [[Cadence Melville|sister]], Marlowe fell off the raft and into the ocean, drowning with her last sight being of this colossal creature, [[The Great Whale]]. In drowning, Marlowe clawed at her throat, leaving scars. [[The Great Whale]] swallowed Marlowe into his mouth, bestowing a source of magic into her soul, and divined her desired destination, sending her there through his blowhole launching her miles across the world. She landed on the beach of [[Lake Prospect]]. In the dead of night, she ran into a [[The Man who found Marlowe|man]], who led her to the location she was supposed to meet up with her father that night. They met up, and the three went down to the police station. In entering through the immigration process, her ID was processed, and she was ushered to the back for what is fronted as the "psychological screening". She entered a transfer corridor, and then entered a room with a friendly [[The Immigration Agent|man]] and runes on the floor. The runes lit up, and the next thing she remembers is leaving the police station with her Identification.

At [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]]'s house, [[Jessica May|his mom]] continues making dinner as him and [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] head upstairs to Caspian's room. They begin talking about math and the equation that Caspian had been working on that he found in his [[Georgia Forrest|father's]] briefcase. In investigating the wand that was left behind with the formulas, Caspian realized that the carvings in the wood were fundamental runes that allow those runes to be involved in the math that needed to be done to perform the magic. The magic can be done without a wand, and can be drawn out, but a wand allows the user to imagine the function created by the formula and cast the spell without having to draw it. Realizing this, Caspian used his limited knowledge of the runes to manipulate his window into opening, enthusing to Ian. Ian, trying to ease Caspian's discovery of magic, manipulated a cloud into pushing the window back down. Caspian, now more completely mind blown about the discovery that his friend can do magic, investigates Ian pondering what else he can do, eventually understanding that Ian is homeless without parents, and that he is a spirit in the form of a small red Chinese dragon. They talk about him living at Caspian's, and head down to dinner.

Arriving at the park, [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] shows [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] the spot where he discovered [[Hazel Eyes]]'s tree. They begin talking about the strange experience, and leads to Shen revealing how she turned into [[Rachel De Narris]] yesterday, and that when she was under and her mother died, she somehow turned herself into a prettier version of herself, one that looked more like her mother. [[Apricot (Alvin)]] notices that a flower spirit is approaching them and draws attention to it. The flower sprit sprouts and says "He is here", with others following saying "We must bring him to the [[Cedrela, the Queen Bee Spirit|Queen]]", referring to Benito as the "him". Skeptical and cautious, they follow the flowers deeper into the forest and come across a large bee hive, with a large bee with a dress emerging. The bee turns into her human beauty, the form of a woman in a black and yellow sundress, and introduces herself as [[Cedrela, the Queen Bee Spirit]].
