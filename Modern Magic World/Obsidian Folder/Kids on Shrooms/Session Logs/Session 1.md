We opened onto West Paradise High School.

We opened in Mrs. Barbara Turner's Algebra 2 class, with Mrs. Turner going over the code of conduct for the school. We see that [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]]is chewing bubble gum and zoning the fuck out. She is sitting next to [[Damien De Narris]], who is leaning back with his hands behind his head, doing his performative cool guy pose. Shen calls him out, and he tries to play it off.

[[Ian Long (Aaron)]] is in the same class towards the back, sitting alone. A person in front of him asks for a pencil, and nothing else arises.

We find [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] in Dr. Charles York's Advanced Environmental Science class. Benito is multitasking between taking notes in the beginning teachings of this class, and planning the Club Fest that takes place during Tuesday and Wednesday. Benito is sitting next to [[Rebecca Kim]], his Vice President for the Senior Class, and they begin discussing various ideas for the event.

In Dr. Ronald Foster's Advanced Physics 1 class, [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] has already finished the example that the class was asked to work on, mere seconds after it was given out. Instead, he is focused on a Physics 3 equation, that continues to take up the rest of his time.

Not long before the bell rings, we find [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] in Biology taught by Mrs. Amy Ulrich. Mrs. Ulrich has just finished going into great detail about the code of conduct, and is starting attendance as Marlowe begins to hum to herself. This is heard by Mrs. Ulrich and is brought great attention to, as Mrs. Ulrich asks for silence in her class. She then continues to next ask for Marlowe's attendance. Some friends of [[Kayla Mendez]], a friend of Marlowe, turn to witness the event thoroughly.

As the bell rings, we follow [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] and [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] out of Algebra 2. As Shen leaves the building, she encounters [[Rachel De Narris]] and [[Madison Leclair]]. Talking to them, Rachel says that they are going to smoke in their car, and then go do other stuff. Shen hastily tries to join, being rejected due to the knowledge that Rachel's car is a convertible with 2 seats. Madison offers up the trunk, with Shen agreeing to come along before learning that the trunk does not connect to the inside of the car. The two girls laugh about it, with Shen walking away embarrassed. [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] and [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] witness this. Benito extends a sad thumbs up, knowing the hell Rachel can spew, and Ian gives a devastating comfort of "Its ok, they pick on me too." In walking away, Shen drops her phone, cracking it, and sees the reflections of the selves she does not want to be. She is able to hold her pretty form.

[[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] leaves class noticing at a distance a figure that could be Shen, and steers clear. [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] catches up with Caspian, asking how his classes are. They exchange a simple conversation, and [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] joins recognizing that they have the entire schedule tomorrow the same as Ian. [[Kerry Burch]] approaches from behind Caspian being overly friendly, and ends up asking him to help with his Geometry homework. Caspian agrees and after Marlowe mentions that they need help in Geometry too, Caspian is now holding it upon himself to start a Geometry club.

We return to [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] as he attempts to sneak by [[Rachel De Narris]], his ex-fling, in the student parking lot. He successfully avoids her by sprinting by crazily fast as she is not looking. However, chasing after Benito is [[Julian Alvarez]], not nearly as fast, and screaming his name at the top of his lungs. Julian catches up, and catches a ride as the two go to play soccer, but not before honking at Rachel and flipping her off.

As [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] boards Bus #4 and sits next to the first open seat, one next to [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]], Marlowe pops on her favorite "mysterious girl" playlist and begins lightly singing along. Her song, her voice, echoes in the ears of those who can hear her quiet tune, that being Shen and a boy named Morgan James across the bus hall. The two, infatuated, almost as listening to the softest lullaby, fall asleep. Marlowe exits the bus at her correct stop, stop #3. Although this was Shen's stop too, she does not wake until the bus reaches the last stop, stop #8. As she wakes and exits the bus, she realizes that she is alone in a different part of town, with no grandfather to rely on as he is busy at the factory. In a moment of panic, she looks to her cracked phone looking for someone to call, and focuses on the reflection of her original self. A sad truth shines on Shen, that although this is the second time she has shapeshifted and does not know her way back to her pretty self, she is likely much safer journeying home alone if she is not a pretty young girl.

[[Benito Garcia (Mela)]]and [[Julian Alvarez]] arrive at the Golden Clearing Park. Julian rants to Benito about his day, mentioning that there was a rumor going around about one of the portables being haunted, with smoke and mist filling the portable at night time. After entering the park, the two began practicing passing the ball back and forth. After not too long, Julian passes the ball down a hill towards the forests, on the side closer to Benito. Benito ventures into the forest to retrieve the ball. After entering the forest clearing that the ball rolled to, he found the soccer ball underneath an apricot tree with many, many leaves around the base of it. After grabbing the ball, he notices an apricot pit on the leaves. The leaves then began to drop underneath him, leading him into a small sinkhole connecting to a wide base of the tree, with a door in the wood. Before he could get the fuck out, the door opened, and was greeted by Thistle the Elk. Thistle requested Benito come inside with a somber "Please". Inside, Benito witnessed a decaying hut, with only half of a living room left standing. Benito then met [[Hazel Eyes]], bedridden and being very happy to meet Benito. Hazel Eyes introduced herself, and asked Benito if he could do something for her, as she is about to die. She told him that the woods are having less and less care as she grows, and asks Benito to keep watch of them for her after she goes. Benito agrees, and Hazel hands him her Oak heart. She declares that the Witch of the Eternal Woods shall be passed on to him, passes, and as she lets go, the heart carries Benito into the floor as the wood walls cave in around him. Benito wakes back up as if he was sleeping underneath the apricot tree, and sees the last leaf fall from the branches. After he stands up, the same apricot seed falls on his head, and after he collects both the leaf and the seed, he runs back to Julian who was calling out for him.

We follow [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] he arrives at home with his mother, [[Jessica May]]. His mother begins to discuss Caspian's day with him, getting excited to hear that he is making a few friends, and getting worried to hear that people may be bullying him. She collects the names "Caroline Rodgers" and "Johnathan Blackhand" as people that may be bullying Caspian, but is persuaded by Caspian to not call the school as it would just bring embarrassment down onto Caspian. She begins talking to Caspian about the things he's been working on that isn't his school work and gets on his case about him not wanting to be further ahead, then gets off his case when she hears him talk about wanting to make more friends. As they finish dinner, she says she loves him and he goes to his room. In his room, Caspian works for a bit finishing his physics 3 problem he was working on, and realized that the math wasn’t perfectly adding up to what it should. Moving on to the geometry homework for Kerry and realized he needs a protractor, he heads downstairs and asks his mom where one might be. Looking around her office alone, Caspian ends up finding a briefcase with his father's initials. Cleverly opening it, he finds that the briefcase opens up to a corridor that leads to a small room, seemingly inside the briefcase instead of in the apartment. He crawls inside, finding a desk with 4 papers on it, and a wooden rod he fails to recognize as a wand. After taking a second to try to understand the hyper advanced math written on the paper, he collects the items and exits the briefcase, carrying them hastily to his room, as if nothing happened. He finishes the night by making fast work of the geometry homework.

In ending the session, we had one last look at the school after hours, nearby the portables. Ian, exiting the bathroom, sneakily heads back to Portable #13, but not sneakily enough. He enters the portable, and after closing the door, fog fills the door's window.
