## [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]]
[[Georgia Forrest]] - What was he looking for:
- For [[The Etheri]]: 
	- Top Priority: Report any dangerous magic that is nation shattering or worse.
	- Second Priority: Identify key contact points to the [[Scholars of Avira]] and identify how deep the corruption goes. Is Astaria worth saving at all?
- For [[Astaria#The HUMI|The HUMI]]:
	- Top Priority: Investigate [[Wonder! Aerospace and Defense]] to ensure only the qualified personnel for Project: Touch the Stars was working on it. Eliminate anyone who was unqualified.

Georgia got caught by the HUMI when he tried reaching out to [[The Etheri]] once he discovered the intentions for Project: Touch the Stars. He had the base equations that were being built upon by the project as proof to [[The Etheri]]. The intention was to send the information back for actions to be made upon it, but once his position was compromised he has done small sabotage missions for [[The Etheri]] ever since leaving the country.

The only thing [[The Etheri]] was able to do was convince people in the [[Rane]] government to start a war, with an ally of [[Astaria]] as it would take time away from the project at the corporation Wonder!. The Etheri do not nearly know that this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to knowledge on magic.  

## [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]]
If Benito goes back to the park, play the spirit scene:
- As he investigates where the tree used to be, he will notice sunflowers and dandelions start to "sneak up on him". These are actually flower spirits, and as their pedals flow in the wind to be caught by another stem, the wind will whistle the sound: It is him! He is the one she left for us! We must introduce him to the queen!
- He will meet [[Cedrela, the Queen Bee Spirit]] 

- The chipmunk will steal Benito's Apricot seed.

Benito's story will involve the unfinished business of [[Hazel Eyes]]
