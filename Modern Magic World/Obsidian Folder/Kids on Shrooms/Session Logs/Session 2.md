Previous: [[Session 1]]
Next: [[Session 3]]

We started the session with [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] getting off of the bus and walking home. She makes her way to her apartment to find that her father is not home and has left her a note saying that he is working late and to take care of herself tonight, stating "you know the drill". Marlowe checks the fridge and finds that the milk is almost out and there is no eggs, leaving nothing in the fridge to really eat. She then gets ready and relaxes for a bit, before heading out to walk to work.

The session pans over to [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]], whos Uber has arrived for them. Inside the Uber, a dejected Shen scrolls through their phone looking at pictures of her and [[Li SiSheng|mom]]. As she's looking on her broken phone, a Instagram post pops up from [[Rachel De Narris]], showing her, [[Madison Leclair]], and [[Lexi Conner]] at the [[Velvet Row]], an outdoor shopping plaza. Shen comments to this post: "OMG you guys look sooo good!!" which is replied with "omg thanks girl, next time ur coming<3". The driver then attempts to make small talk with Shen, which is swiftly shut down by Shen, justly so.
Arriving at home, Shen arranges flowers at her mother's memorial as she normally does, and notices that her hands seem to slightly faze through to the hands of her prettier self. She goes to her bathroom and sheds her illusion, with it turning into mist as she eyes herself from head to toe. Unfamiliar to any of the supernatural happening here, but curious about what she can do, she looks at Rachel's Instagram post and successfully recreates herself as Rachel. But instead of creating an illusion, she slowly transforms herself physically, crafting herself as a physical copy. In trying to change her voice, she realizes that she has the ability to easily change her vocal cords to change and mimic other voices. After her [[Li LewMingzhi|grandfather]] comes home entering the other room, she takes a minute to process the abilities she has learned she has, and experiences how difficult it is to find her way back to her normal appearance. It is not difficult, but the further away she gets, the harder it is to find her way back. She leaves the bathroom and lays existentially on her bed.

The session continues at [[West Paradise High School]], with [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] waking in his portable to the sound of an approaching vehicle. Quickly, he sees that it is a golf cart with a janitor and a police officer in it, and he darts into the ceiling boards to hide. The two investigate the portable, and find no trace of anyone, leading the police officer to tell off the janitor. The two leave, and Ian eats a snack only to realize that he does not have enough food to suit his needs. Ian attempts to return to sleep, only for the janitor to return to the portable stealthily. In a haste, Ian transforms into his human form and hides underneath a desk, allowing the mist to hide him as well. The janitor begins to investigate the room, but is warded off by the AC unit kicking back on, and darts away with the portable unlocked. Ian collects himself and returns to sleep.

We now see Benito holding the ball as he walks back to where him and [[Julian Alvarez]] were playing soccer. Julian asks where he had been, to the only response of "Ball". After playing, Julian convinces Benito to take him to [[Fiesta]] and pay for it, and then Benito takes them both home. Once Benito arrives at home, he converses in the SGA group chat to ensure that the club row tomorrow will go off smoothly, and checks on Shen as she had not been responding. Shen responds to a DM, and Benito works on some homework and SGA work afterwards. Before bed, Benito places the apricot seed into the secret compartment in his bedside table.

After [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] arrives home from work, it is around midnight, and she notices a note on the microwave saying "Open Me". She looks inside and sees some leftovers from a fast food place that her father picked up on the way home. Instinctually saying "Awww, I love my dad", she gets the response of "I love you too kiddo". Her [[Vincenzo (Vince) Melville|father]] approaches behind her apologizing for the long hours at the factory and says that hes been waiting up for her. The two talk for a bit with her father expressing how if her teachers keep picking on her to let him know and he'll complain to the school. Afterwards they both begin their nightly ritual of praying at the family altar. In doing so, Marlowe is thinking of the rest of her family that has had unknown fates since the accident on the way to Astaria. In singing a prayer song, she receives a feeling inside of her of pure confirmation, almost as her family is praying besides her somewhere else. She knows for certain that her family is alive. Once the two are done praying, her father heads to bed and Marlowe does her homework for a bit before heading to bed herself.

In the morning on the way to school, Marlowe was singing "The less I know the better" on the bus and somehow hit the brown note. This caused the [[Stanley Reed|bus driver]] to completely shit his pants, along with another kid named [[Cameron Perry]]. Some other students, such as Shen, let out fluctuance in response. 

In arriving at school, [[Kerry Burch]] approached [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]] to ask for his geometry homework, to which Caspian handed it over. Kerry then asked how geometry club was going and if they were going to be at club row today, to which Caspian took it upon himself to make it his mission to host geometry club at club row.

[[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] and [[Ian Long (Aaron)]] arrived at Ceramics together, where they sat together and exchanged a few words. Marlowe noticed the hot teacher, [[Devon Foster|Mr. Foster]], along with some other students.

In Advanced Avira History, led by [[Dr. Angela Bennet]], [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)|Caspian]] joined [[Ian Long (Aaron)|Ian]] and [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)|Marlowe]] in sitting together, and talked to them about joining the geometry club and trying to host it at the club row. They remembered that club row is this afternoon during lunch, so they would need to hurry. In creating this small club, the group decided that Caspian was the best fit for the role of President of the Geometry club, and also talked about turning it into a general math club too. A [[Anthony Prince|kid]] sitting in front of them asked if they were starting a math club, and when they said yes, he scoffed, laughed, and turned around.

In setting up club row, [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] and [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] were hanging banners and setting up the stands, to which Shen apologized to Benito for taking too long to respond. Benito was confused on why Shen was apologizing as he claimed she had no reason too, and [[Jace Shotwell|Jace]], also setting up, piped in that she was just being polite and to lighten up, perhaps a little too passive aggressively. 

Soon enough lunch hit, and [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]], [[Ian Long (Aaron)]], and [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] all made their way to the club row to ask about setting up their new Geometry club at a stand. [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]], who made the layout, begrudgingly responded to Caspian (a loser), that there was no availability on the club row and they would not be able to join as they did not sign up. [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] also jumped in, asking if they were an official club, to which they said not yet. Benito also pointed out the point that they need 5 members and an advisor to officially host a club anyway. Ian, hungry for food, rushes off to lunch during this discussion, and once the discussion finishes, Caspain and Marlowe follow. [[Rachel De Narris]], [[Madison Leclair]], and [[Lexi Conner]] all approach [[Jace Shotwell]] at club row and beckon Shen to come over. They ask Shen to come back with them to lunch, which Shen refuses as she continues to work the club row after asking Benito and getting the response of needing a replacement. 

After Club Row, [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]], [[Ian Long (Aaron)]], [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]], and [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]] all make their way to Aviran 2. Because Shen is late, she is forced to sit at the only seat, at the table with Caspian, Ian, and Marlowe. Shen attempts to keep to herself nad avoid any contact with the rest.

[[Benito Garcia (Mela)]] goes to the library for Study Advisement, led by [[George Walker]]. Benito immediately notices that getting help in Study Hall is his ex, [[Rachel De Narris]], and talks to his advisor George. George asks if Benito would like to stay and help with the study hall kids, or go advise a class in need of help. Choosing the later to avoid his ex, he goes to the Aviran 2 class led by the new teacher Mr. [[Weylin Whitley]]. 

Benito finds himself in the Aviran 2 class that Caspian, Ian, Marlowe, and Shen are in. In talking to the teacher briefly, he tells Benito to just walk around and get attendances and to chill. Benito passes the attendance sheet around Shen's table, and makes some awkward quick talk between the group.

As the school day ends, we move on to the next session.
