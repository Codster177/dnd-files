Aurorlin's appearance is that of an endless dark Manta Ray with no stinger or mouth. Many cultures believe that it is impossible to see Aurorlin's face, as they are endless as is the night sky. Few have claimed to spot their face leading the twilight into the night. It is said that those who spot Aurorlin's face get a wish to spend on their wildest dreams.

## Backstory:

## Themes:

Aurorlin is the representation of the atmosphere and that beyond. Aurorlin and [[The Great Moth - Sola]] are the last protection of [[Avira]] from [[The Great Horrors]] of the universe, if [[The Goddess]] was to ever fail at protecting her children. Where [[The Great Moth - Sola]] protects the world from the closest great horror, processing it into the sun to the mortals of the world, Aurorlin is focused on protecting the [[Avira]] from the rest of the horrors in the universe, and processes them into the stars of the night sky.
