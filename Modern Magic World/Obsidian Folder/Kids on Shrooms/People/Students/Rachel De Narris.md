## Relationships:
### Family:
- [[Howard De Narris]]
	- Father
	- Is a posh and formal father, with a fixation on control and order. However, he has a soft spot for his precious daughter, who should be able to do whatever she wants.
	- Is a Wizard of the [[Scholars of Avira]]. Teaches [[Damien De Narris]] in the ways of wizardry. There has been times where Rachel has seen him teaching Damien, enough so that Rachel has a permanent enchantment on her that causes her to forget memories that have to do with magic.
- [[Mason De Narris]]
	- Father
	- Is a careless mother who does not talk much anymore. Has had enough enchantments casted on him for him to basically be a slave to Howard. Mostly does chores around the house and yardwork. Also is in charge of running Howards business.
	- The trophy husband to Howard De Narris. 
- [[Damien De Narris]]
	- Brother
	- Worry filled, wanting to be cool guy at school. Similar to Rachel, he wants to be treated like he is better than everyone. Contrary to her, he is not charismatic, so when people treat him like the brat he is, he get emotional and angry, instead of verbally putting someone in their place.
	- Is treated like a failure to his father constantly and can never do enough. Damien works with his father to get better at learning magic, and although he is magically capable, he is relatively disappointing and Howard expects him to be better.
