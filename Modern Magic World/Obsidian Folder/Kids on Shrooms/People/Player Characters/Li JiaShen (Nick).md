## Character Breakdown:
What year is your character? 
Sophomore 

What is your appearance like? 
I didn't always look conventionally attractive, I'll elaborate on that in my backstory. For now I will give an OLD LOOK and NEW LOOK. 
OLD LOOK: More of a flat face. I had very chubby features while I was moderately fit for my age. My hair would sometimes feel brittle, like I was cursed to feel uncomfortable with myself. WINK WINK. 
NEW LOOK: I look like what you'd imagine like the unhealthy asian beauty standard to be for a younger girl. A nice almost pointy chin with fair skin that seemingly glows, long wavy black hair, pretty skinny yet has an athletic build. 

What kind of cliques or clichés would your character be a part of? 
Kind of imagine the main character from mean girls, except without all the revenge, just more envy. My entire life I felt rejected due to my appearance and now I am looking upon the “mean girl” clique with my past envy yet mixed with new found confidence in my new appearance that I may be able to weasel my way into it. 

What are your character's goals? 
Right now my character is in a limbo of discovering who she truly is. With the recent passing of her mother, her mother being the only nuclear family member Shen had left. Shen has formed into what she believes to be a blank slate, she is grieving the many losses in her life by believing she can disconnect from it all by creating a new person within herself. 
Shen’s current MAIN goal is to create a reputation for herself, she is a selfless person, but she is willing to do selfish things to become what she perceives to be cool.

What are your character's fears? 
Letting down her family. Although, all she has left is her grandfather, she takes the fact that she’s his only grandchild as a source of anxiety. Shen feels as if she’s pressured to succeed otherwise all of her family’s hard work would be for naught. 

What is different about your characters appearance, personality, goals, and fears, from now and the end of the campaign? What do you want to go through that will change them into being this different person? 
I don’t know what her appearance will be like near the end since you know its kind of a blank slate, but I believe she will eventually realize a lot of her goals are selfish and in turn will not actually make her into a more successful person. I want her to go through the grief of self-idolization turned into an identity crisis. Also I am still thinking of how exactly she got her powers, but I def want it to be related to spirits, SO I think there would be some spirits trying to take my powers from me and stuff like that.

### Players:
- [[Caspian Forrest (Kai)]]
	- Bullies them
- [[Benito Garcia (Mela)]]
	- Acquaintances through SGA.
	- Actual play history:
		- [[Session 1]]:
			- After being embarrassed by Rachel and Madison, Benito attempted to make Shen feel a little better by offering his support. That is, he walked up to her, gave her a thumbs up, and awkwardly shuffled away.
- [[Ian Long (Aaron)]]
	- Strangers
	- Actual play history:
		- [[Session 1]]:
			- After being embarrassed by Rachel and Madison, and having Benito offer some sort of solace, Ian attempted to do the same by saying to Shen: "Its ok, I get made fun of too." This had the opposite effect, as Shen then felt one with the losers, and was thrown into immense embarrassment.
### Family:
- [[Li SiSheng]]
	- Mother
	- Deceased
- [[Li ShiWang]]
	- Father
	- Deceased
- [[Li LewMingzhi]]
	- Grandfather

### School:
- [[Rachel De Narris]]
	- "Friend"
	- More like subservient
	- First in the hot shit clique. Will be friends to Shen, but will also be bitchy. Means well enough.
	- Actual play history:
		- [[Session 1]]:
			- Rachel and Madison ran into Shen during dismissals of the first day of school. Rachel and Madison told Shen that they were going to Rachel's car to smoke and then hang out afterwards. Shen acted like she was invited, to which Madison said she wasn't initially. Only because Rachel's car is a two seater, of course. Madison jokingly offered Shen to ride in the trunk, to which Shen agreed, only to realize that it would be an awful experience and she was being made fun of. They all laughed about it "together" and Shen walked away embarrassed.
- [[Madison Leclair]]
	- "Friend"
	- More like passive aggressive enemy.
	- Second in the hot shit clique. Madison will try to keep Rachel to herself with every chance she gets. Thus, she manifests that in trying to embarrass Lexi and Shen whenever she can to try to "reduce their social status".
- [[Lexi Conner]]
	- Friend
	- Third in the hot shit clique. Lexi is with the hot shits mostly for the comfort, and because Rachel wants Lexi to act stupid, she does. Lexi doesn't take it personally and just likes to hang out with them and have other people think she's hot shit. As long as Shen doesn't get in her way, Lexi is an ally.
- [[Damien De Narris]]
	- Acquaintance
	- Knows him because he is Rachel's brother.
	- Actual play history:
		- Damien sat next to Shen in Algebra 2. Damien hit a pose to act all cool, and Shen correctly called him out on it.
- [[Jace Shotwell]]
	- Acquaintance
	- Knows him because he is Rachel's boyfriend. He is also in SGA with her.
