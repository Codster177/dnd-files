## Character Breakdown:
What year is your character? 
Sophomore 

What is your appearance like? 
Medium build on the scrawny side. Think like, a "long" body. Spectacle glasses, exclusively wears khaki slacks and plain/beige clothing with suspenders. For a fancy occasion, he might wear a cabbie hat and a khaki suit instead of suspenders. 

What kind of cliques or clichés would your character be a part of? 
Nerd 

What are your character's goals? 
My character's goals are to avoid being a nuisance to anyone while maximizing his usefulness. He has a deep and desperate need to be liked by everyone at all times. Deep down, he wants to be able to contribute something meaningful to the world at large. But, at his current level of maturity, this manifests as a strong propensity towards people-pleasing. 

What are your character's fears? 
His paramount fear is making anybody even a little bit upset. This isn't a moral position though, he's just immensely uncomfortable with anyone disliking him even a little bit. Otherwise, he is hesitant to do anything that could set back his progress towards maximizing his utility to society. He also has a fear of walnuts because he is allergic. 

What is different about your characters appearance, personality, goals, and fears, from now and the end of the campaign? What do you want to go through that will change them into being this different person? 
I think the healthiest and most "ideal" progression for my character's personality/goals etc. would be for him to realize that he should be living his life for _him_. He has a good heart deep down, and if he embraces his fundamental desire to help others, he will be able to serve himself and the world at the same time by following his passion unabashedly. This means that he would have to deconstruct his fear of upsetting anyone, and instead learn to focus on doing the right thing, not the thing that results in the fewest people disliking him even one bit. That being said, my character starts in a place where he could be easily manipulated if someone appeals to his insecurity instead of his intellect. I could also see him living out a more tragic story about someone with a good heart and potential being led astray by their need to be validated. Any of that works LOL.

## Backstory:
Ever since the day I was born, my dad and I did everything together. After coming home from work, he would linger over my crib for hours, just smiling and stretching his hand out. When I got a little older, I remember hearing the lock in our door turn a little after 5:30 every day. It would make me smile. My heart floated in my chest. I’d run up to dad and hug his leg, and he would laugh. He always played catch with me, and said I was gonna be a great athlete, just like he was in school. 

Unfortunately, my coordination wasn’t ever that good. Ever since I was small, I was more into math, physics, and building things. When I was four, I remember building a birdhouse for our small porch with wooden hinges on the interior door. I showed my dad, and he liked it. But I could tell he really wanted me to be good at catching, throwing, these kinds of things. He started to get a little fed up with me. 

I tried to be good at sports, but honestly, I just wasn’t interested. When I turned six, I said I wanted to focus on learning. Dad got really mad. Mom got mad at him for that. Dad used to laugh whenever he looked at me. But since then, I could feel his gaze from across the room. It was so much colder. I don’t think that I became the kid he was expecting me to. 

This is the part that’s a little bit harder. 

On 24th of Second Spring my first grade year, I came home and mom was crying. Dad had left the house. She seemed really upset, but I knew why he left. I told her, “I’m sorry mom. I don’t think dad liked me anymore. That’s why he left.” I was trying to help, but that made her cry harder. At least my mom likes me. She does everything she can to make sure that I get to do math and physics without having to worry about other stuff. It’s good that my mom likes me. Otherwise, I would have to change. But I don’t.

## Rumors:
- Good Rumor: I help anyone with their homework if they ask, like, not super meanly.
- Bad Rumor: Chewed on pencils until getting bullied for it in freshman year. Now I only write in pen.
- Fake Rumor: I keep a file on everyone in each of my classes.
- Fake Rumor: I can't swim. People think this because I don't like to get in the pool.
