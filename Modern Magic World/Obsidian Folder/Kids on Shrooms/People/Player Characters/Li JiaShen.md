## Relationships:
### Players:
- [[Caspian Forrest]]
	- Bullies them
- [[Benito Garcia]]
	- Acquaintances through SGA.
	- Actual play history:
		- [[Session 1]]:
			- After being embarrassed by Rachel and Madison, Benito attempted to make Shen feel a little better by offering his support. That is, he walked up to her, gave her a thumbs up, and awkwardly shuffled away.
- [[Ian Long]]
	- Strangers
	- Actual play history:
		- [[Session 1]]:
			- After being embarrassed by Rachel and Madison, and having Benito offer some sort of solace, Ian attempted to do the same by saying to Shen: "Its ok, I get made fun of too." This had the opposite effect, as Shen then felt one with the losers, and was thrown into immense embarrassment.
### Family:
- Shen's Mother
	- Mother
	- Deceased
- Shen's Father
	- Father
	- Deceased
- Shen's Grandfather
	- Grandfather

### School:
- [[Rachel De Narris]]
	- "Friend"
	- More like subservient
	- First in the hot shit clique. Will be friends to Shen, but will also be bitchy. Means well enough.
	- Actual play history:
		- [[Session 1]]:
			- Rachel and Madison ran into Shen during dismissals of the first day of school. Rachel and Madison told Shen that they were going to Rachel's car to smoke and then hang out afterwards. Shen acted like she was invited, to which Madison said she wasn't initially. Only because Rachel's car is a two seater, of course. Madison jokingly offered Shen to ride in the trunk, to which Shen agreed, only to realize that it would be an awful experience and she was being made fun of. They all laughed about it "together" and Shen walked away embarrassed.
- [[Madison Leclair]]
	- "Friend"
	- More like passive aggressive enemy.
	- Second in the hot shit clique. Madison will try to keep Rachel to herself with every chance she gets. Thus, she manifests that in trying to embarrass Lexi and Shen whenever she can to try to "reduce their social status".
- [[Lexi Conner]]
	- Friend
	- Third in the hot shit clique. Lexi is with the hot shits mostly for the comfort, and because Rachel wants Lexi to act stupid, she does. Lexi doesn't take it personally and just likes to hang out with them and have other people think she's hot shit. As long as Shen doesn't get in her way, Lexi is an ally.
- [[Damien De Narris]]
	- Acquaintance
	- Knows him because he is Rachel's brother.
	- Actual play history:
		- Damien sat next to Shen in Algebra 2. Damien hit a pose to act all cool, and Shen correctly called him out on it.
- [[Jace Shotwell]]
	- Acquaintance
	- Knows him because he is Rachel's boyfriend. He is also in SGA with her.
