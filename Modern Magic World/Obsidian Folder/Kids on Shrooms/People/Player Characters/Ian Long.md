Ian Long is the character played by Aaron in this campaign. Ian is more of a quiet kid that is usually just another face in the crowd. He is interested in the arts and human culture, and truly has a love for learning more about the world.

Ian is secretly a spirit. His spirit form is that of a Cloud Serpent Dragon, and uses the his magic to shape the clouds to his will.

His actual birthday is unknown to him. However, the birthday on his school records and the day he celebrates his birthday (although he's never really had anyone to celebrate with) is 1/16/1605, or the 16th of First Spring, 1605. This makes him "16" years old.
