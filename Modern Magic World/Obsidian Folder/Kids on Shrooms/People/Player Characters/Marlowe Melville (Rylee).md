## Rumors:
- Good Rumor: Last year I was the only freshman girl to get into competitive choir.
- Bad Rumor: I am poor asf and lowkey scavenges for proper food / clothes.
- False Rumor: I slept with the choir president.
- False Rumor: My dad is involved with illegal stuff to keep them afloat. (He's scary looking so people could assume he fixes cars for gangs, he is a mechanic.) The truth is he will often work night shifts to keep up with bills.

		- [[Session 1]]:
			- As [[Marlowe Melville (Rylee)]] boards Bus #4 and sits next to the first open seat, one next to [[Li JiaShen (Nick)]], Marlowe pops on her favorite "mysterious girl" playlist and begins lightly singing along. Her song, her voice, echoes in the ears of those who can hear her quiet tune, that being Shen and a boy named Morgan James across the bus hall. The two, infatuated, almost as listening to the softest lullaby, fall asleep. Marlowe exits the bus at her correct stop, stop #3. Although this was Shen's stop too, she does not wake until the bus reaches the last stop, stop #8. As she wakes and exits the bus, she realizes that she is alone in a different part of town, with no grandfather to rely on as he is busy at the factory.
