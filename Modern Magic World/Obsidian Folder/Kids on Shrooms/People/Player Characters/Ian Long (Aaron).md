Ian Long is the character played by Aaron in this campaign. Ian is more of a quiet kid that is usually just another face in the crowd. He is interested in the arts and human culture, and truly has a love for learning more about the world.

Ian is secretly a spirit. His spirit form is that of a Cloud Serpent Dragon, and uses the his magic to shape the clouds to his will.

His actual birthday is unknown to him. However, the birthday on his school records and the day he celebrates his birthday (although he's never really had anyone to celebrate with) is 1/16/1605, or the 16th of First Spring, 1605. This makes him "16" years old.

## Character Breakdown:
What year is your character? 
Sophomore

What is your appearance like? 
Human form would contain features that are generic to the area (for example if brown hair is the most common, he’d have brown hair. We can talk about it, this part is up to change).
He has brown hair and blue eyes.
My spirit form: a red/black Chinese dragon. No whiskers. Surrounding my back/mane is a darker than scales color red hair/fur. Size is slightly larger than a small dog.

What kind of cliques or clichés would your character be a part of? 
He doesn't have any definite clique he is apart of. because he is a spirit, its hard for him to fit in. He wouldn't make much conversation if he didn't have to as to not draw attention to himself. Not in the quiet kid way, he just doesn't seek conversation.

What are your character's goals? 
learn about the world as much as he can. He wants to find his place in the world as a spirit and find more out about his abilities. He also wishes he had close friends that can help with these goals.

What are your character's fears?
He is afraid of being found out as a spirit. He would be fine telling people that he trusts, but not any normal person.

## Background:
One day, at an unknown time, the little dragon emerged. The little dragon did not remember the details of his birth, or if he even had parents, all he knew is his curiosity. He had a burning desire to explore, to learn the world around him. One day, he decided to wonder into the city, unaware of some peoples distain of spirits, and was found and chased out. Almost instinctually he understood he needed to disguise as a human if he wanted to learn more. He would watch movies to understand human interactions better. One day, he was curious about the local school, and wanted to join to learn more things. He waited for the school year to start, signaled by the school busses around the town, and waltz right into school. He of course wasn't enrolled so they chased him out. Feeling very sad, the little dragon went to sleep with one thing in mind, the urge to get enrolled to the school. As if the universe had listened, the next day every paper that he needed was there. The little dragon took on the name Ian Long, and went to his first day of school.
