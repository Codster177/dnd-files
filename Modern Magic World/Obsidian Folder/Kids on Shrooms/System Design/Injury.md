In Kids on Shrooms, we will have three stages of injury, and one last stage of death.

| Injury State  | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Gameplay Mechanics                                                                                                                                                                                  | Natural Solution                                                                                                                                      |

| Light Injury  | A cut, burn, or bruise. Might leave a mark, but is generally not going to kill you.                                                                                           | No gameplay penalties.                                                                                                                                                                              | At most an hour of treatment.                                                                                                                         |
| Medium Injury | A slash from a sword, a piercing blow from a spell, a gunshot, or a lost small appendage (finger, ear, eye). Will scar leaving a story on your body, and will hurt like hell. | When spending stupid points, spend double the amount for the same effect.                                                                                                                           | A day of professional treatment to clear the medium injury. To clear the light injury, a week of rest.                                                |
| Heavy Injury  | Getting hit by a truck, loosing a limb, surviving a fireball, or falling from a cliff. Count yourself lucky to be alive and keep trying to survive!                           | Injury specific penalties might be put into affect. (Disadvantage for activities with two arms when only having one.)<br><br>Adrenaline bonus: Gain 10 stupid points to try to keep yourself alive. | A week of professional treatment to clear the heavy and medium injury. Light injury can remain for a few months, a year, or life if it is bad enough. |
| Death         | Your character has sadly died.                                                                                                                                                | Character is no longer playable.                                                                                                                                                                    | No natural solutions are known.                                                                                                                       |
When taking injuries, your character will usually roll a constitution stat check. On a failure, depending on the situation, they may take a Light, Medium, or Heavy Injury, or if it is a very serious case, they may die.

Typically, it depends on what is injuring you, and how severe the damage is. A man with a butter knife attacking may only be able to do light injuries on your character, medium injuries in very rare scenarios. However, a tyrannosaurus rex might do a Heavy Injury just by biting you once.

Injuries can stack. If you already have a light injury, and the thing attacking you is damaging enough, hitting you again can lead to a medium injury, where hitting a non injured person would lead to a light injury. 

The injury system is designed to be very narrative focused, like the rest of the system. The DM will work to ensure things are not unfair, yet there is still challenges when there should be. Reflecting the narrative focus, we will also aim to keep track where lingering and untreated injuries remain on the body, and roleplay accordingly.
