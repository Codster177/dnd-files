A character will start with 3 D4s and 3 D6s. They will place them in the following D&D esq stat categories:
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Intelligence
- Constitution
- Charisma
- Wisdom

In order to level up, you need to explode a given dice for the amount on that dice. For example, if you have a D6 in a stat, you will need to explode 6 times to level up to an 8. On a given roll, an exploded 6 will still lead to you rolling an 8 and adding it to the roll and adding 1 to the level up explode counter. If the 8 explodes as well, you continue to the next die up and add 1 again to the level up explode counter.

The magic stat operates the same way, but always starts at a D4.
