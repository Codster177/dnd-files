When rolling stealth, find the new stealth DC by adding half of the original DC to the original DC, and subtract by your character's stealth value. 

For example, if:
- You are rolling a stealth check with strength and magic that has the DC of 12
- Your stealth value is 2
- -> You find the new DC as 12 + 6 = 18, then minus 2 = 16.

Your character's stealth value starts at 0 and increases one of the two ways:
- Dexterity Die: For every die above a 1D4 your Dexterity Die is, add 1 to your character's stealth value. Basically, whenever you level up your Dexterity Die, add 1.
- Stealth Explosions: Every time you explode with a stealth roll, add 1.
